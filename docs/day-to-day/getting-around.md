# Getting around

Japan has very good public transport. But before that, walking around. But before *that*, how Japanese cities are laid out.

## City layouts

Japanese cities are laid out in a fairly uniquely Japanese way. From a map,  However, city layouts are similar-ish to an American grid-like layout. But, not quite. 

Japanese cities and towns are divided into districts, called *chōme* (丁目). While these are somewhat similar to city blocks, they're not squares and not in a proper grid, and there are a whole bunch of small streets within each *chōme*. These small streets don't have names, addresses just have a number such as 10-13-7, which can also be written as 10丁目13-7 as that is the 10th *chōme*. I think. And I don't know how to figure out what the other numbers mean. Honestly, Japanese addresses confuse me. But what it means is that if you're trying to find a specific address, particularly if it's a house rather than a hotel, it can be a little confusing. There will be signs/stickers around which will help you figure out where you're looking for but if you're trying to find a residential address having a photo of the property, or someone to meet you, will help. If you're going to a commercial address or a hotel though it'll be fairly easy to find.

## Walking

Japan is a good place to walk around. It felt pretty comfortable and familiar as a European - plenty of footpaths/sidewalks to use and whatnot.
