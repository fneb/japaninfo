# What to carry with you on a daily basis {docsify-ignore}

There are a few things worth carrying with you on a regular basis.

- **Passport**, this is a legal requirement for all non-Japanese citizens to carry on their person at all times. Police can ask to see it at any point, and if you don't have it on you you'd better hope you're travelling with someone who can go back to your hotel and retrieve it for you. So, make sure you have it with you before heading out.
- Cash. Many places are cash-only, so you'll want to make sure you have plenty on you. See the [spending money](surviving/spending-money.md) page for more info on money.
- Some way of figuring out how to get around. My suggestion would be making sure you have a smartphone with a SIM card that you can happily use data on. Google Maps works well, I've found.
- A backup map of some sort wouldn't go amiss.
- A note of your hotel's name and address would be handy in case you need to grab a taxi, or ask for directions. The hotel's name in English/Roman letters would work, even better would be a business card or such for the hotel or something else fhat has the full address.
