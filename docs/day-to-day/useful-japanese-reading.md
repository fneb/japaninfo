# Some useful Japanese

Some Japanese you'll never need to say, but may need to read - for instance, to make sure you go into the correct toilets, knowing (or having a list containing) the character for "woman" or "man" will help. Otherwise, how to say common phrases such as "where is the toilet" can be handy.

## Japanese characters (that you probably only need to be able to read not say)

* 女 - Woman (may be on toilet or onsen/hot spring doors). 3 lines, as if there is one horizontal for the arms, then one (with a bend in it) going down forming the head and right leg, and the last line forming the other side of the body and the left leg.
* 男 - Man (likewise important for toilet genders). A big ol' head on a body.
* 止 - Stop. Note that it is 4 lines, two vertical, one on the ground and one on the side. Particularly important if you want to use the roads in Japan, you'll often see the word "止まれ", the instruction form of the verb "to stop", written on the ground or on a sign.
* 口 - Mouth. Won't be important by itself. Look, it looks like a mouth.
* 入 - Enter. Looks like a tent with a little flag on the top.
* 出 - Exit. This is made up of the symbol for a mountain, 山, stacked upon itself. It's like a trident with another trident on the end of it.
* 入口 or 入り口 - Entrance. The "enter mouth" for a building.
* 出口 - Exit, as in, the exit for a building.
* 人 - Person. Not really important but note that it doesn't have the little line at the top - that makes it different to 入. Small differences like this will generally be fairly clear on typefaced signs (as opposed to "handwritten" style fonts) so keep an eye out.
* 火 - Fire. The character for person above, 人, but with two lines next to it. Fire can be scary.
* 水 - Water. A line down the middle, two coming off the side, and a little chevron on the left. Water can be important.
* 子 - Child. One zig-zagged line with a horizontal line through it. 
* 円 - Yen. Internationally, we use ¥ as a prefix (for instance, ¥1000) but in Japan it's usually 円 that is used as a suffix (for instance, １０００円).

## Numbers

Some restaurant signs - typically when the menu is written on boards on the wall (with text written vertically) rather than a hand-out menu - use *some* Japanese numbers. For instance, 六五〇円. This isn't technically proper Japanese but that's handy for us as it means just needing a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

* 一 - 1
* ニ - 2
* 三 - 3
* 四 - 4
* 五 - 5
* 六 - 6
* 七 - 7
* 八 - 8
* 九 - 9
* 十 - 10
* 〇 - literally just a circle, but in this case it's representing a zero.

So, our example above of 六五〇円 is 650 yen.

## Time and date

* 日 - Sun, or day. Like a couple of boxes stacked on top of each other.
* 月 - Moon, or month. Like the sun but with legs.
* 時 - Hour, or time. Bit complicated, but it's a sun (as above) with a temple next to it. The time will often be written out as, for instance, "１０時-２1時" for a shop's opening hours. 24 hour time is widely used but not exclusively. 午前１０時 would be 10 a.m., 午後１０時 is 10 p.m.. You won't need to remember the a.m./p.m. characters but having them written down for reference can be handy!
* 年 - Year.
* Dates are written out in the form: ２０２１年０７月２３日. Pretty easy to read once you have your head around which character is which. You may also see a character in brackets after a date. For instance, ０７月２３日(金). This refers to the day of the week - specifically, the first character of the below. In this case, it's the 23rd of July (the 7th momth), and it is a Friday.

## Days of the week

The second and third characters are the same throughout. Fun fact, these are based around the 5 Chinese elements, the sun and the moon.
* 月曜日 - Monday
* 火曜日 - Tuesday
* 水曜日 - Wednesday
* 木曜日 - Thursday
* 金曜日 - Friday
* 土曜日 - Saturday
* 日曜日 - Sunday
