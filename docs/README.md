# Japan travel tips

A bunch of - hopefully - useful information for travelling to and around Japan.

## Why?

I've been to Japan a grand total of two times, which means I'm definitely not an expert. However, it's a country that I know a lot of people are interested in travelling to and I've given out a bunch of information to a bunch of people about travelling there. Rather than give out a different set of some of the information to each person, I decided to actually write it all up on a website. Feel free to share this site with others!

## Topics

Topics I have, or will, cover here include:

- Basics about the country.
- How to get around via public transport, particularly in Tōkyō.
- Driving in Japan.
- Some basics of how to pronounce Japanese words, and some phrases.
- Some suggestions for the types of things to go and see.
- Onsen (hot spring) ettiquette! I would definitely recommend giving this a read.

## Who are you?

My name's Bethany. I live in London, and as such some of this documentation will be from a British gaze (for instance, how to drive in Japan). I'd been interested in Japan since I was a kid, when I played a game called [Shogun: Total War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogun:_Total_War) set during an era of civil war over 400 years ago, then later started watching anime. I started learning some Japanese around this time, though didn't get far. My interest has been a bit on the back-burner during much of my 20s, but in recent years it's picked back up, including learning a bunch more Japanese and in particular vocabulary and kanji. I finally visited Japan in April of 2019, then again in December.

## What's so good/bad about Japan?

The draws to me of Japan are:

 - Aspects of the culture and history. The country still feels quite connected with its pre-20th century past due to how rapidly it modernised. People are generally respectful and polite and whatnot that appeals to parts of my Britishness - we may be known as being fond of queueing, but we don't like queueing as much as in Japan.
 - The pleasant feeling of cities and the beautiful countryside. When I last went to Tōkyō I was surprised at how at home I felt there. I do live in a big city, London, myself so that'll definitely be part of it (though it is still far smaller than Tōkyō), but it felt pretty comfortable to me. And the countryside is beautiful, similarly comfortable for different reasons, and quiet. With most of the population based in cities, the countryside is pretty quiet. I live in a big city but grew up in the countryside, so I feel the appeal of this too.
 - Fiction that the country produces. I couldn't tell you why, but I really like the different way that storytelling is done is in Japanese fiction. I mostly read yuri manga, which is essentially lesbian fiction, and I really like the gentle pace and mostly-realistic nature of "slice-of-life" material.
 - Hot springs! I do wish we had similar bathing over here in Europe.

The things that I don't like about Japan as much:

 - Aspects of the culture and history. The history is the obvious part, as it's often brutal and perhaps not accepted as much as it could be. The UK has its own problems with history so I guess this is something that stands out to me. The culture is fairly conservative and group-focussed, which is at odds with me being very much on the political left, and the west being much more individualistic. In the UK we often celebrate our oddballs and it's not uncommon to see interesting characters on the tube, but in Japan it's much more about maintaining the group peace and stability - the nail that sticks out gets the hammer. A victim of bullying may be ostracised themselves because they are involved in the bullying, which is pretty rubbish to say the least. Still, the bright colours and silly Japanese gameshows show that it's a different kind of cultural expression.
 - Being a foreigner in Japan. Being the nail that sticks out, a 175cm tall white person with green hair, I do somewhat stand out in Japan. I've found it's not super-bad actually, but I gather that the racism towards black people in particular is pretty bad. I'd suggest researching some black people's perspectives if you want to learn more on this.
 - Politics, again how conservative it is. The ruling party, which has been in power most of the time since 1945, is a centre-right party with elements that are much further to the right. This results in some stuff like unequal marriage - being queer, this is a somewhat obvious issue to me. Marriage is written in the constitution as being between a man and a woman (as a way of making the two equal members of the marriage instead of the woman being subservient to the man) and, as I understand it, a majority of the population are in favour of same-sex marriage being legalised. But because the leading political party is against this it's not likely going to happen soon. And since this party is who most vote for, it shows where the hearts of many people truly lie.
 - Smoking. It's still allowed indoors in many places. I think they're looking to change this in the build-up to the Olympics, but judging from the advert I read on the Tôkyô Metro (which, since it was in Japanese, I could have been mis-reading) I don't think they're going for a full smoking ban in bars and restaurants. 
 - Oh so much single-use plastic. Yuck.

## Get in touch

I haven't set up an email address for this website yet but I'll put it here when I getting around to doing the thing.

## Website info

This website is running on [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/), an open source static website system. It seems pretty cool so far. I should update this site more often.
