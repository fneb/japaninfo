# Basic facts {docsify-ignore}

So, the basics about Japan.

- **Capital city:** Tōkyō, 東京. That diacritical mark called a macron, or a circumflex, both indicate a long vowel sound - it's said as "Toukyou".
- **Official language:** Japanese, 日本語. It's written with a mix of character sets, one of which is much the same as traditional Chinese. More info [here](before-trip/japanese-language.md).
- **Number system:** Mostly, Arabic number characters are used (so, 1, 5, 643, etc.). Some places, such as some restaurant menus' pricing (places where they're not expecting international tourists) may use the kanji numbers instead, but it's not too common, still in base-10 format, and you can probably use a translation app or a number chart to figure it out.
- **Currency:** Yen, JPY. Currency symbols: Internationally, ¥ (used as a prefix) but domestically 円 (used as a suffix) is mostly used. There's no decimal point or sub-currency unit like cents or pence in other currencies - 1円 is the smallest demonination of currency.
- **Currency conversion:** I generally use the rule of thumb of 100円 is USD $1, though it's actually a bit weaker than that. Head [here](https://fx-rate.net/calculator/?c_input=JPY&cp_input=USD&amount_from=1000) to check out the current rate for 1000円.
- **Roads:** Drive on the left, use metric units. Kilometres for distance, kmph for speed.
- **Date format:** Year (年), month (月), date/day (日). Month, date for short. A character in brackets afterwards indicates the day of the week, but it'll probably be easier to ignore this if you don't know any Japanese. For example, ２０２０年０１月３１日 or ０１月３１日（金） would be the date I'm writing this on. 
- **Population:** Around 126 million. Mostly urbanised.
- **Climate:** Predominantly a temperate climate with Northern hemisphere seasons. However, because the country is so long and narrow, there's quite a bit of variation. Rule of thumb though, warmer to the south-west (Kyūshuū and Shikoku islands in particular, but also the western end of the main island Honshū) and colder in the mountains and north of Tōkyō. It can get very hot in Summer with a highest recorded temperature of 41.1°C near Tōkyō, and very cold in Winter with a lowest recorded temperature of -41°C in Hokkaidō. It can be pretty wet too, in particular a rainy season from roughly early June to mid-July that affects most of the main islands which can involve all-day rain. Depending on what you want to do, avoiding the rainy season may be a good idea!
- **Geography:** Japan's a mountainous country in the northern hemisphere, and most cities are on the coasts. It's mostly a long, thin set of islands. Area-wise, it's about as big as the UK, the Republic of Ireland, and then another Ireland. The main islands are:
  - Honshū 本州, the biggest island where most of the famous cities are, including Tōkyō, Ōsaka 大阪, Kyōto 京都, Nagoya 名古屋, Hiroshima 広島, and others.
  - Kyūshū 九州 to the south-west, including the cities of Nagasaki 長崎, Fukuoka 福岡 and Kumamoto 熊本.
  - Hokkaidō 北海道 to the north, and as a result a bunch colder. Sapporo 札幌 is the main city here.
  - Shikoku 四国 south of Honshū and east of Kyūshū. Biggest city here is Matsuyama, 松山.
  - Okinawa 沖縄, the main island of a set of tropical/subtropical islands further south-west of Kyūshū. No-where near as big as the four main islands above, but worth noting.    
- The biggest city areas are Tōkyō by a long way (around 38 million for the Kantō region which encompasses the Tōkyō metropolitan area), then Ōsaka and nearby cities (Ōsaka, Kōbe, Kyōto form the Keihanshin area of around 19 million).
