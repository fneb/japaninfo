* Japanese language

Japanese is a pretty interesting language.

The character sets used are hiragana (ひらがな) and katakana (カタカナ) which collectively form the kana, and kanji (漢字) or Chinese characters. None of these are alphabets. Hiragana and katakana are syllabaries which means each character is a syllable, and kanji is a logographic script which means that each character represents a word or idea. Written Japanese will typically use a mix of these, along with some occasional rōmaji (ローマジ) - Roman letters. Writing is traditionally written in lines from top-to-bottom, with subsequent lines being to the left (meaning books start from the "back"), but will also be written in the same way as English - left-to-right, with subsequent lines being below.
