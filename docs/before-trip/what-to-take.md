# What to take {docsify-ignore}

While there are plenty of things that are typical "holiday" things to bring, there are a few things worth making sure you have.
## Bring with you before you go
- A pen. You'll need to fill in an immigration form and a customs form on the plane, to hand in at the relevant places when going through the airport. Make sure you have a pen handy in your hand luggage as a result.
- A JR Rail pass or a regional pass, if you're planning on travelling around the country by train. These can save you a bunch of money compared to taking these trains on the day, and often have to be purchased prior to departure. Where you buy these will depend on which country you're coming from as a result, but if you're coming from the United Kingdom, a couple of options are [JR Pass by HIS](https://www.jrpass.co.uk/en/) or [Japan Rail Pass by Japan Experience](https://www.japan-rail-pass.co.uk/?currency-code=GBP&ap=b6021as).
- Some sort of international currency-friendly card, including ATM withdrawals as a lot of places are still cash-only. In the UK several "challenger banks" have sprung up over recent years that allow for good exchange rates, so it's worth investigating your options in advance.
- Some way of getting onto the Internet. It's the future, after all, and tools such as Google Maps make getting around incredibly easy. You've got a couple of options listed below, and while you can go for either in the airport, it's nice to get this prepared in advance even if only to reduce travel-day stress and make it easy to find your way around the airport. Many hotels and the like will provide Wi-Fi but just like anywhere they can be hit-or-miss, whereas cellular services are generally fantastic. I've sat next to a kid on the Tōkyō Metro who was playing a multiplayer online video game on his phone no problem.
 - A Pocket Wi-Fi. Also called a MiFi elsewhere (such as here in the UK). Basically a small battery powered device that provides you with your own Wi-Fi access point so you can get onto the Internet via 4G or the like. Typically, you rent the device and pay for the service all in one so you don't need to buy the device outright.
 - A data SIM card. The vast majority of SIM cards for foreigners are data-only, but that's all you need. If you have a SIM-unlocked phone this can be a much cheaper way of getting onto the Internet.  
 A SIM card is my preferred option. It means that I can use my phone as normal without worrying about charging up an additional device at the end of each day, and it's a bunch cheaper too. I've bought mine from [here](https://www.japan-rail-pass.co.uk/services/simcard) in the past and had no complaints. Other places to buy SIM cards in advance are available.
## Things to either bring with you, or buy in Japan
- A towel and some body soap alongside shampoo/conditioner. Some places, particularly if it's a public bath as part of your accommodation, will have towels and body soap/shampoo/conditioner of their own for you to use, but if you're going to a sentou (public bathhouse) you'll likely need your own. You can always buy these in Japan though including in conbini.
- Something to scrub yourself with in an onsen/public bath, such as a flannel, a body sponge, loofah, or the like. Even if the bath you're going to provides towels and soap, they won't provide you with something along these lines. More info on the onsen ettiquette page.
- If you get ill, including "just a cold": masks. You can find these in conbini.
