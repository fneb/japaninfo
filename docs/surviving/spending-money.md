# Spending money {docsify-ignore}

- As mentioned in the [Basics](before-trip/basics.md) page, the currency in Japan is the Yen. While internationally the symbol ¥ is used, this isn't the symbol typically used in Japan. You'll usually see money values written with Arabic numerals and with the 円 character as a suffix. So, for instance, 1000円. And there are no sub-values of yen, 1円 is the lowest value of currency. You can use [this page](https://fx-rate.net/calculator/?c_input=JPY&cp_input=USD&amount_from=1000) to see the current exchange rate to USD or your currency of choice.
- Tax isn't included in the listed price on most things. At the time of writing, consumption tax is 10%, which makes adding it to the cost of things easy enough. There may be additional taxes beyond this, such as a hotel tax.
- Many places are cash-only. As a result, ATMs will give you the option to withdraw large amounts. Whereas here in the UK the lowest option that an ATM will typically give you to withdraw is £10, in Japan it's more like 10,000円 - around £70 at time of writing. Make sure you keep a fair bit of cash on you, including to cover for bills at restaurants. Hotels will generally take card though as will larger chains of shops and restaurants, as well as more places in cities versus the countryside. It's generally a pretty safe place so you won't need to worry too much about your money being stolen (though don't ignore the possibility) but make sure you don't lose a big wad of cash!
- Speaking of restaurants: No tipping. It's not the culturally expected thing. So, the price you pay on the bill is the whole amount. Don't try and tip or you'll confuse the staff!
- Restaurants are often a bit cheaper at lunch time compared to dinner time, and will often close for a few hours from perhaps around 2:30pm to perhaps around 5:30pm.
- At the time of writing, plastic carrier bags are free and given out by default when buying things. If you've got into the mindset of not wanting single-use carrier bags for environmental reasons and want to ask for your stuff without a bag, the phrase to use is "ofukuro nashi kudasai" (お袋なし下さい) which means "please give it to me without a bag".

## Using a card and ATMs

- As mentioned, Japan is a very cash-based economy. While many places will accept card, I would suggest assuming that's the exception rather than the norm and to make sure you have a fair bit of cash on you. It's worth noting that topping up an IC card (ie Suica or Pasmo card) is done at a self-serve terminal and all the ones I've seen have been cash-only, so if you're planning on using an IC card to travel from the airport you'll need to get some cash out before topping up/buying a card. There'll probably be an ATM near the IC card top-up point though.
- I'd suggest trying to find a credit or debit card that has as little or no foreign currency fees, and hopefully as much of a free ATM withdrawal limit as possible. In the UK there are several challenger banks that have sprung up over the last few years that are worth researching, and credit card comparison sites may also be helpful.
- ATMs are found pretty easily. If in doubt go to a *conbini* (convenience store). Many are open 24/7 and have an ATM inside. Common *conbini* chains are 7-Eleven, FamilyMart, and Lawson. Also, handily, *conbini* often accept card payments.
- Some ATMs may charge you a fee for withdrawals, maybe around 200-400円. I think ATMs in 7-Eleven don't charge a fee. This is separate from any fees your card issuer may charge.
- When paying for stuff directly on a card, it'll typically us the magstrip rather than chip-and-PIN and may or may not need your signature. If you have the option to enable/disable magstrip payments as a security feature, make sure you have these payments enabled.
- As mentioned, these payments may or may not require your signature or PIN number, which is a bit disconcerting. I've typically found this to be the case in *conbini*. They have a place to insert your card as if it were a chip-and-PIN payment, then after a few seconds it asks you to remove your card and the payment is complete, without asking for your PIN number or the staff member requiring your signature. 

## Tax-free shopping

The tax-free process is a little different compared to some countries. Instead of claiming sales tax back at the airport, you simply don't pay the tax at the point of purchase (or sometimes claim it back at a separate counter in the shop after purchase). There are certain conditions around this though.

- You must be on a valid tourist visa.
- You must have your passport with you (but as a foreigner you're legally required to have it on you at all times anyway).
- The shop must be part of the tax-free shopping system - not all are. They'll usually advertise this fact, and perhaps have a sign near the till saying they offer tax-free shopping.
- Your purchase must be more than a set amount before tax, which I think is 5400円 or thereabouts.
- You must be purchasing, and claiming the tax back, all on the same day.
- The item(s) purchased through this must leave with you when you leave the country.

To do the purchase, do the following:

- Find the stuff you're buying.
- Go to the till as normal.
- Ask for tax-free shopping. If you don't speak Japanese, I'd suggest awkwardly brandishing your passport and pointing at a tax-free shopping sign at the till, or saying "muzei shoppingu kudasai" or just "tax free shopping kudasai". The written Japanese would be 無税ショッピング下さい。
- If the tax-free thing is all done at the till:
 - The shop assistant will take your passport.
 - Transaction will proceed as normal.
 - Shop assistant will tape or staple a tax-free receipt into your passport, and stamp the receipt/passport too.
- If you claim the tax back elsewhere:
 - Shop assistant will try and awkwardly explain this to you, including where to go to do this. Ask them to draw a map or such.
 - Buy your stuff as normal.
 - Take your purchased stuff to the tax-free shopping desk.
 - Awkwardly brandish your passport, receipt, and probably the bag with your items in. Point at a sign that says "tax-free shopping", or say "muzei shoppingu kudasai" or "tax free shopping kudasai", as above.
 - The staff member will take your passport, possibly print out an additional receipt, and either tape or stable a receipt into your passport and stamp it.
 - They'll then give you the tax back, probably in cash even if you paid by card, along with your passport and receipt(s).
- At the end of your trip, you'll need to show your passport and your products to a customs desk in the outgoing airport. I think this desk is just after security, which means it's after you've checked any luggage in. While the staff I've come across have generally been pretty lax about checking you actually have everything you've purchased with you, I'd suggest trying to have any tax-free shopping in your hand luggage just in case as much as possible.
