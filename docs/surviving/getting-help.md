# Getting help

Hopefully, you won't run into any trouble but you can never predict these things!

## Emergency phone numbers

Japan has separate phone numbers for police, and for fire/ambulance.

**Note that if you have a Japanese SIM card for travel in Japan, it may not be able to do phone calls.**

Police: 110
Fire/Ambulance: 119

Talking in English may be a problem, but in an emergency try anyway. Searching online indicates that English should be okay particularly in bigger cities, and with better luck with the non-police line. If you aren't able to speak with someone in English, try talking in basic verbs/nouns. "Help, money stolen, Ikebukuro, my name is Firstname Lastname", that sort of thing. Japanese as a language uses a fair few loan words from English, so you may have middling success.

Another option for getting help from police is to find a "police box". The Japanese is 交番, "kōban" (may be written on the building without the diacritical mark). A police box is basically a tiny police station, more like a manned post. It'll be somewhere you can find police officers without needing a phone.

## Dealing with police

This doesn't constitute legal advice, please do your own research as I'm just an IT nerd not a lawyer.

There are two situations where you'd need to deal with police - when you need help, and when you get in trouble. I believe that if you get into trouble, you are entitled to an interpreter. Additionally, it's worth considering standard civil liberties advice of not saying anything without a lawyer present. However, Japan is notorious for having a corrupt criminal justice system and so that may not be doable. Not a subject that I can advise much on. In any case, try and get an interpreter as a minimum.
